**The dictionary:**

It could be made by using built-in python dictionary and it's "in" keyword, but it surely wasn't the point, so I tried not to use it.

**Nth-largest:**

My other ideas were:

  - to use built-in max(list) (then remove element and do it again - so many times as nth-largest number parameter)
  - to get list smaller by converting it to set, by this removing duplicates and performing operation described above (taking max())
